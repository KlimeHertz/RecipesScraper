If you dont want to use walnuts, you could use pecans or go nut-free by substituting with ¼ cup chopped raisins, prunes, or granola! Another great substitution is ¼ cup of rolled quick oats moistened with a tablespoon of water before stuffing the apples. Use a grapefruit spoon that has the sharp edges (or a melon baller or small pairing knife) and core most of the way through, I leave about ½ inch apple left at the bottom. You could remove the skin but I find that it helps to hold the apple together as it bakes - it also adds extra fiber which is always a plus. Fill the apples with the filling and place them in the crock-pot. Pour the apple juice or cider (and the liquor, if using) into the crock-pot, around the apples. If you dont have apple juice or cider, you can use apple lime juice or apple vinegar (diluted with water and a little sugar). Set the crock-pot on high heat and cook 2½ to 3 hours until the apples are soft and begin to collapse. If you dont have a crockpot, you can use a 7x11 casserole dish or stock pot. Preheat the oven to 350F and cover the pan with aluminum foil. Theyll take about 45 minutes to one hour. A glass baking dish is also an option, just be sure to lower the heat slightly 5-10 degrees since glass can cause food to burn. If youre making this recipe for a large crowd, you could do these in the oven in a large disposable roasting pan and just double the recipe. They also taste delish with a scoop of low-fat frozen vanilla yogurt. You can refrigerate these for up to 3 days, but store them in an air-tight container so they dont pick up odors from the fridge.   submitted by  FabitFun - Click here for more!",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/media/7262/crockpotapples.jpg

Slice the roast into 4 equal sized pieces and remove any excess fat or gristle. Rub the meat on all sides with the salt mixture then wrap each piece tightly in plastic wrap. Place the meat on a plate and allow to sit overnight in the refrigerator.   Place the Roast in a Slow Cooker on LOW for 6-8 hours.   Meanwhile, make the  Blue Cheese Coleslaw : In a medium bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, celery salt, Kosher salt and pepper. Pour enough of the mayonnaise dressing over the shredded cabbages and grated carrots to moisten them. Add in the crumbled blue cheese and chopped parsley and toss well to combine. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for a few hours to allow the flavors to combine.   Make the  Barbecue Sauce : Combine the onion and reserved fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until the onion has softened, about 10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and chili powder and cook, stirring constantly until well combined and aromatic, about 30 seconds. Stir in remaining sauce ingredients and reserved juices and simmer until thickened, about 15-20 minutes. Allow the sauce to cool slightly before straining the sauce if you prefer a velvety texture.   Assemble the Sandwiches: Split and lightly toast each hamburger bun. Using 2 forks, pull the beef apart into shreds, discarding any excess fat or gristle. In a saucepan set over low heat, toss the beef with enough barbecue sauce to moisten the meat well. When heated through, place the sauced beef on top of the bottom half of each bun.

Either by hand or with a pastry cutter, cut in the shortening till the mixture is crumbly. If the mixture looks more floury than crumbly, be sure to add just one or two more tablespoons of shortening till it is crumbly. Add about 3/4 cup hot water to the mixture, or just enough to make the ingredients look moist.  3 With your hand or a large fork, knead the mixture making sure to rub the dough against the sides of the large mixing bowl to gather any clinging dough. If the dough still sticks to the side of the bowl, add a couple more tablespoons of flour until the dough forms a soft round shape. The dough is ready to roll out now, but it is best to let it rest. Cover it with a dish towel, and let it sit for about an hour or so.  4 Take the dough, and pull it apart into 10 to 12 balls. Lightly flour your rolling area, and roll each ball with a rolling pin to about 1/8 inch thickness.  5 Place each tortilla on a medium hot cast iron skillet. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes on each side, or until the tortilla does not look doughy.  6 Bread Machine:.  7 Combine flour, baking powder,optional dried pasta sauce mix, and salt in bread machine. Cut shortening into pieces about the size of olives, and drop inches.  8 Start mix cycle and slowly add tap water. Let cycle run five or six minutes, then stop machine.  9 Remove dough from bread machine, cover with a warm wet towel and let sit for 15 minutes, so dough can relax. (Do not skip this step or dough will be difficult to form into tortillas.).  10 Pinch off egg-sized pieces of dough and roll into balls. Use a rolling pin to roll them into thin rounds.  11 Heat a dry cast-iron skillet to medium. Transfer tortillas to skillet and cook until spots on the bottom are dark brown.

The onions should start to brown, but without burning (a couple of onions may be burnt here and there, but overall they should not be charred). Reduce heat to medium and continue cooking onions for 10 more minutes, continuing to stir, as onions brown even more without burning. At this point add just a pinch of salt over onions. Continue cooking for 10 more minutes on medium or low heat, stirring occasionally to make sure onions don’t stick to the bottom of the pan or burn. Total you should have cooked onions for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle onions with a small amount of balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan. Using spatula, mix the onions, scraping the bottom of the pan and coating onions with a pinch of balsamic vinegar you just added. 2) While you’re caramelizing the onions, cook bacon: I usually bake it in the oven at 350 until it just turns crispy. Drain the bacon on paper towels and chop into small pieces. 3) Cook elbow macaroni according to package instructions. Rinse the macaroni under cold running water, drain. Set aside. 4) In a large saucepan, add heavy cream, milk, sharp white cheddar cheese, Gruyere cheese and 1/4 teaspoon salt on medium heat, stir and mix, until cheeses start to blend. Add black pepper, Cayenne pepper and paprika to your taste, or omit them if you don’t want them. Add elbow macaroni to the creamy sauce, stir to coat on low heat for about 5-10 minutes until cheeses melt completely and coat the macaroni. 6) Add caramelized onions and chopped bacon to the creamy macaroni. 7) Serve on warm plates (warmed in the oven) as is, or with more cheese (finely grated) sprinkled on top. much more at http://juliasalbum.com/macaroni-and-cheese-with-bacon-and-caramelized-onions-recipe/",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/Media/Recipe/food60-001.jpg

Mix with a spoon, then let sit until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add in 2 1/2 cups flour, salt, garlic powder and dried basil, stirring with a spoon until the dough comes together but it still sticky. Using your hands, form the dough into a ball and work the additional 1/2 cup flour (you dont need to use all if it is not needed) in to the dough, kneading it on a floured surface for a few minutes. Rub the same bowl with olive oil then place the dough inside, turning to coat. Cover with a towel and place in a warm place to rise for about 1 1/2 hours.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.   After the dough has risen, punch it down and place it back on the floured surface. Using a roll pin or your hands, form it into your desired shape (sometimes I use baking sheets and do rectangles or free form pizzas). Place the towel back over the dough and let sit in the warm place for 10 minutes. While the dough is rising again, melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Mix it with the garlic and 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese.   Bring the dough back out and using a spoon or pastry brush, douse the outside edges with the butter and garlic mixture. You can spread the butter all over, just make sure to focus on the edges. Use it all up! Continue to make your pizza with your desired toppings. Bake the pizza for 23-25 minutes (or longer if needed, depending on your toppings), or until crust and cheese are both golden. While pizza is baking, melt remaining butter and combine with the last tablespoon of parmesan.   Remove pizza from over and immediately brush the outside edges with parmesan butter, using it all up. Sprinkle a bit of parmesan over top if desired. Serve!   Note: I realize that if you buy yeast in the packets, it can be a pain to measure 3 teaspoons. If you dont want to do that, I suggest making a double recipe of this crust. However! I also prefer buying jars of yeast these days instead of packets, and just keeping it in the fridge, so I suggest doing that. more at howsweeteats.com",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/Media/Recipe/1333525521breaksand.jpg

Remove from fry oil and place on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle generously with salt.   As soon as French fries are cool to the touch line a 12” skillet or a pizza pan with the French Fries. Using the sides of the skillet or the edge of the pizza pan as a guide make a circular crust with the fries in a single layer. Fill in and holes with additional fries. Don’t be afraid to break the fries into smaller pieces to fill in the gaps. A nice even layer of fries is what you are looking for.   Take 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella and sprinkle in an even layer across the French fries. The cheese will act as glue, keeping your “crust” together. So be liberal with the cheese and make sure there is some covering the entire pizza in a single layer and in all the nooks and crannies. Place in 400 degree F oven for 5 minutes.   Remove pizza from oven. The cheese should be melted thoroughly. Set pan on a heat safe surface. Turn your oven setting to broil.   Spoon ¾ cup of tomato sauce in an even and circular layer across the top of your pizza keeping about a half inch away from the edges. Now spread the remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese over the sauce also keeping a half inch away from the edge. At this point add your toppings (optional).   Place the pan back in the oven, which is now on broil, for an additional 5 minutes or until the top of your cheese begins to brown.

If this isnt done thoroughly (until no particles of shortening remain visible), the tortillas will have an irregular texture.  Dissolve the salt in the water and pour about 2/3 cup over the dry ingredients and immediately work it in with a fork; the dough will be in large clumps.  If all the dry ingredients havent been dampened, add the rest of the liquid (plus a little more, if necessary).  Scoop the dough onto your work surface and knead until smooth.  It should be a medium-stiff consistency not firm, but not quite as soft as most bread dough either. Divide the dough into 12 portions and roll each into a ball.  Set them on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 30 minutes. This makes the dough easier to roll. Heat an ungreased griddle or heavy skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Flatten a ball of dough, flour it, then roll forward and back across it; rotate a sixth of a turn and roll forward and back again; continue rotating and rolling until you reach a 7-inch circle, lightly flouring the tortilla and work surface from time to time. Lay the tortilla on the hot griddle (you should hear a faint sizzle and see an almost immediate bubbling across the surface).  After 30 to 45 seconds, when there are browned splotches underneath, flip it over.  Bake 30 to 45 seconds more, until the other side is browned; dont over bake the tortilla or it will become crisp.

Mix together the light and dark soy sauce, the oyster sauce, rice wine, cornstarch, and black pepper in a large bowl, stirring to dissolve the cornstarch.

When wings are done marinating, add enough oil to just barely cover the bottom of your skillet and allow to heat up. Gently lay out enough chicken wings to cover the skillet (I was able to fit about 8-10 each time), and be careful because they will inevitably cause the oil to splatter while they pan-fry. Flip them after a few minutes, and pan-fry the other side, until both sides are nicely golden. Set the batch aside and continue to pan-fry the rest of your wings.   4. When all the wings have been pan-fried, add them all back into the skillet along with the onions and garlic. Pour in any leftover marinade that you might have. Cover pan and allow to cook for an additional 10 minutes, until the juices run clear when you pierce the wing meat.   5.

In a large ziploc bag, combine all the marinade ingredients. When everything is well-combined, add the shrimp, squeeze as much air as possible out of the bag, and close it up. Place it in the fridge. 2.) Let the shrimp marinate for 30-60 minutes, flipping the bag around once or twice during that time, so that all the shrimp stay evenly covered in the marinade. 3.) When youre ready to cook, take the shrimp out of the fridge and let them sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; there is no need to add any oil or butter to the pan, as the marinade has enough oil in it to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. (If you would prefer to use the grill for these, you can thread them onto skewers and toss them on the grill at this point.) 4.) Add your shrimp to the pan in a single layer, making sure they are not too crowded; you can always cook them in more than one batch. Let them cook on one side for about a minute, until they curl up and start to turn pink. Flip them over, and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the shrimp are opaque.

If it bubbles rapidly, your oil is probably hot enough. It should take about 20 minutes to heat up. To make a "deluxe" chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices and a leaf of lettuce.

If the dough is too dry you can add extra water, a tablespoon at a time.  Lightly oil a large bowl. Remove the dough from the mixer and shape into a ball. Place the dough ball in the bowl, cover with a clean towel, and allow to rise for one hour ( or until double in size ).    Note:* I turn on my oven at the lowest temp at 200 while I am doing my food prep. Then I place the bowl in the oven, and turn off the oven with the door slightly open for 30 minutes, then remove it and place on top of the oven for the remainder of the rising time.* Towards the end of rising time, preheat oven to 450 degrees and prepare baking sheets with parchment paper and cooking spray.

Lay 5 halved slices of bacon out on a workstation vertically. Basket-weave the other 5 slices with the 5 on the workstation, making sure the weave is centered and each piece of bacon is equal in length.   Place the seasoned patty on top of the weave, using your hands to compress the patty so that it does not go beyond the bacon. Starting with the vertical-facing slices, pull each end up and over the patty so that they meet in the middle. Begin weaving the horizontal slices into the vertical ones, lifting some slices and tucking the ends into others so that it resembles a near-perfect basket weave and it stays together well. Season both sides of the bacon-wrapped patty with a little bit of pepper.   Preheat the grill to about 325 degrees. Add the burger, weaker side down, onto the grill and leave untouched until the bottom part has been seared together and the bacon is a crisp golden brown, about 15 minutes. Flip, cover, and cook for 5 more minutes. Uncover, and let the burger cook until both sides of the bacon-wrapped burger are golden brown and crisp, and the burger is cooked through and an internal temperature reaches 145 degrees, about 10 minutes more.    Using tongs, turn the burger and place it on a new part of the grill, searing off the bacon on the sides, about 2 minutes per side.",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/media/7244/baconwrappedburgerfin.jpg

Peel and discard the sweet potato skin (or sprinkle it with a pinch of salt and much on it for a snack!). You can do this as much as a day ahead of time. Let the potato cool completely. 2. Place the sweet potato in a medium bowl and crush it with a fork until well mashed. Add the flours and salt. Knead the dough well, adding flour as necessary to allow for easy handling. Avoid adding more flour than necessary to keep the gnocchi from getting tough. 3. When you can easily handle the dough, separate it into four segments and roll each segment on a floured surface into long skinny ropes. Each roll should be approximately 3/4 of an inch in diameter. With a fork, cut each roll into 1/2 inch gnocchi segments. If you’d like to make the traditional grooves in your gnocchi, press each piece of pasta lightly with the fork. You can store these in an airtight container in the fridge for 2–3 days. 4. When you’re ready to cook your gnocchi, boil water just as you would normally for pasta. When the water is boiling, add a pinch of salt and the gnocchi. Keep the gnocchi simmering and stir them periodically to avoid sticking. When they float to the surface of the water, let them cook for another 5–10 minutes to taste. Strain the gnocchi from the water.

If you make them yourself, I don’t think you will ever go back to purchasing taco shells. All you need is some tortillas and cooking spray. We used some small, soft “taco” tortillas. We used the flour kind but corn is fine too. First you want to steam them… Wet some paper towels and wring them out well. Layer the tortillas with the wet paper towels on a plate and then microwave (we did 6 at a time). Keep an eye on them, it should be about 30 seconds until they are steamed. Then lightly spray each side with cooking spray and drape each tortilla over two bars of the oven rack. It is wise to put a baking sheet below them to catch any oil from the cooking spray. Bake at 350-375 degrees for 7-10 minutes. You will be able to tell that they are browning & getting crispy. Take them out and set them aside! Okay, now for the filling All you need is ground beef (2 pounds), 1 can of refried beans, 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 packet of taco seasoning, shredded cheese, & your favorite taco toppings. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet. COMPLETELY drain all grease and return to skillet. Over low heat, add refried beans, taco seasoning, and about half to two-thirds of the tomato sauce (you can eye this to see whats best, you don’t want the filling to be too runny or your tacos will be soggy on the bottoms). Blend well and scoop into the tacos (which should be “standing” in a lightly greased casserole type dish). Then just sprinkle the cheese over the top and bake.

Test the heat of your skillet by throwing a few drops of water onto the surface. When the water sizzles, the pan is ready for the pancake batter.  Turn skillet to low-medium and drop about 1/4 of the batter onto the skillet, then spread out and lightly place one pineapple round in the middle, pushing down just a little.  Repeat with another pancake. Flip pancakes over when the edges become firm and they are able to be flipped without breaking. Continue cooking until desired doneness is reached.

Turn the dough out onto waxed paper and divide into two rounds.  Flatten.  Wrap in waxed paper, plastic wrap, or resealable plastic bag, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly sprinkle a board or other clean surface using some of the 1/3 cup reserved flour.  Sprinkle the top lightly with flour.  With floured hands and a floured rolling pin, roll out one portion of the dough at a time to about 1/4 inch thick.  Fold the dough over to make it 1/2 inch thick.  For each biscuit, dip a 1 to 1 1/4 inch biscuit cutter into reserved flour and cut out the biscuits, starting at the outside edge and cutting very close together, being careful not to twist the cutter.  The scraps may be combined to make additional biscuits, although these scraps make tougher biscuits.  Roll out the second portion when ready to bake. Using a metal spatula if necessary, move the biscuits to an ungreased baking sheet, placing the biscuits 1 inch apart.  Refrigerate the biscuits for 10 to 20 minutes until cold.  Bake the biscuits on the top rack of the oven for a total of 10 to 12 minutes until light golden brown.  After 6 minutes, rotate the pan in the oven so that the front of the pan is now turned to the back, and check to see if the bottoms are browning too quickly.  If so, slide another packing pan underneath to add insulation and retard the browning.  Continue baking another 4 to 6 minutes until the biscuits are light golden brown.  When the biscuits are done, lightly brush the tops with butter.  Turn the biscuits out upside down on a plate to cool slightly.  Serve hot, right side up. These biscuits may be frozen, unbaked or baked, and reheated. more at sandynawrot.com",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/Media/Recipe/13491993590001.jpg

While cooking, salt and pepper the potatoes to taste (they dont have to be too salty as the bacon with help with the saltiness as well) and sprinkle a light pinch of garlic powder. In another pan cook your bacon on medium heat to desired tenderness (I liked mine crispy for this sandwich!). While everything is cooking, slice your bread (use some crusty bread like french or sourdough if you have it), and generously butter the outside of each piece. On the inside, put about 1 tablespoon of sour cream on each slice as well as slices of cheddar cheese on each side. Once your potatoes and bacon are finished frying, dab them on paper towel to remove some grease, then fan the potatoes out on your bottom slice of bread, put a little more sour cream on top of the potatoes if you desire (I did to help the bacon and chives stick in the sandwich). Slice up one green onion stalk and spread it on top of the potatoes along with the bacon. Place your other slice of cheese on top of all of this and top with your bread!

Pour the can of crushed tomatoes into a small bowl. Finely mince the garlic and toss in with the tomatoes (I like to use my microplane to do this since the garlic won’t burn in the sauce and this way you won’t get large chunks of raw garlic while you eat). Stir in the oregano, salt, sugar and pepper. Set aside. Prepare the rolls: Cut off just the very top crust of the roll. Use your fingers to pull out the bread from inside the roll, creating a bowl. Be careful not to pull too much off from close to the sides and bottom as you don’t want the ingredients to leak out. You will want the sides and bottom to be about ½-3/4” thick. (Toast up the bread you pulled out to use as croutons in a soup or salad to avoid waste!) Heat the cooking oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for about 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add the ground beef to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Break up the meat as it cooks with a wooden spoon, stirring frequently until the meat is no longer pink. Remove from the heat and drain using a metal colander. Set aside. Place the “bread bowls” onto a baking sheet. Spread the bottom of each with a good portion of the sauce. Then divide the ground beef mixture among the rolls (you don’t want these to over flow too much, so use less beef if necessary). Layer the mushrooms and the pepperoni on top of the beef. Now top the each bun with the mozzarella cheese. The mixture/cheese should come just barely above the top of the bun as it will sink a little as it cooks.

Set aside until foamy, 5-8 minutes. (If using the instant yeast, you can skip this step and just add it to the flour.) In another bowl, stir together the remaining 2 Tbsp brown sugar and warm milk until dissolved.   Add 2 1/2 cups flour and milk mixture to the yeast. Stir with a wooden spoon until a soft dough forms. Add the remaining flour as needed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead a few times, forming a smooth ball.   Brush the inside of a large clean bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough to the bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow to rise in a warm, draft free area for about 2 hours, until dough has doubled in size and bubbles appear on the surface.   Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 4 equal pieces. Lightly dust your hands and rolling pin with flour. Roll one of the four sections into a 12×4-inch rectangle. With the long side facing you, gently press 1/4 of the ham and cheese into the bottom third of the dough, and roll as tightly as possible, starting with the end that has the filling. Cut into 12 1-inch pieces and transfer to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Repeat with remaining 3 portions of the dough.   Let rest, uncovered, at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400?F.   Bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add the baking soda and reduce heat to a gentle simmer. Boil pretzels in batches, cooking about 20 seconds each, turning once. They should be slightly puffed. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them back to the baking sheets.   Bake until puffed and golden-brown, about 15 minutes.

Slice each breast in half diagonally to create two diamond-like shaped pieces. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into the side of each breast piece. This can be slightly tricky on thinner pieces so be careful. Be sure not to cut all the way through the meat but rather just into one side so that the fillings will stay in. Step 2 Stuff each piece of chicken with 1/2 oz. of cheese and about 4 slices of pepperoni. Lightly season each piece with salt and pepper. Set the stuffed chicken aside. Step 3 Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Begin to heat a large skillet with 6 Tbsp of vegetable oil over medium/high heat. Collect three shallow dishes and put the flour in one, the egg in another and the bread crumbs in the third. Beat the egg until it is an even consistency (adding a 1/2 tsp of water helps break it up). Step 4 One by one, coat each piece of chicken in the flour, then the egg then the bread crumbs. Use your hands so that you can keep the open side of the pocket pinched closed and keep the fillings in. The flour helps the egg adhere and the egg keeps the bread crumbs in place. This is a basic bread coating. Step 5 Test the oil in the skillet to see if it is hot enough by dropping a small pinch of bread crumbs in. The bread crumbs should sizzle and dance A LOT. It is very important that the oil is hot enough or else the breading will soak up a lot of oil and you’ll end up with some really greasy chicken!. Place all four pieces of chicken in the skillet and cook until it is golden brown and crispy on each side. This should take no more than 2-3 minutes. Step 6 When you remove the chicken pieces from the skillet, transfer them to the baking sheet and place it in the oven. Finish baking the chicken (to cook the inside) for about 25 minutes (longer if you have larger pieces). Remove from the oven (check to make sure the chicken is cooked through) and serve immediately! submitted by  Yummrecipes - more here!",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/media/7258/pizzachicken.jpg

You can use a fork to make groove marks on the edges. Freeze the filled empanadas for 10-15 minutes. This is a trick I picked up making tart dough. It lets the butter firm up again ensuring there is no shrinkage and in this case allows the gluing process to complete, so there is no disaster in the oven.

In a large ziploc bag, combine all the marinade ingredients. When everything is well-combined, add the shrimp, squeeze as much air as possible out of the bag, and close it up. Place it in the fridge. 2.) Let the shrimp marinate for 30-60 minutes, flipping the bag around once or twice during that time, so that all the shrimp stay evenly covered in the marinade. 3.) When youre ready to cook, take the shrimp out of the fridge and let them sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; there is no need to add any oil or butter to the pan, as the marinade has enough oil in it to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. (If you would prefer to use the grill for these, you can thread them onto skewers and toss them on the grill at this point.) 4.) Add your shrimp to the pan in a single layer, making sure they are not too crowded; you can always cook them in more than one batch. Let them cook on one side for about a minute, until they curl up and start to turn pink. Flip them over, and cook for another 30 seconds or so, until the shrimp are opaque.

Stir in the oregano, salt, sugar and pepper. Set aside. Prepare the rolls: Cut off just the very top crust of the roll. Use your fingers to pull out the bread from inside the roll, creating a bowl. Be careful not to pull too much off from close to the sides and bottom as you don’t want the ingredients to leak out. You will want the sides and bottom to be about ½-3/4” thick. (Toast up the bread you pulled out to use as croutons in a soup or salad to avoid waste!) Heat the cooking oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté for about 2-3 minutes or until tender. Add the ground beef to the pan and season with salt and pepper. Break up the meat as it cooks with a wooden spoon, stirring frequently until the meat is no longer pink. Remove from the heat and drain using a metal colander. Set aside. Place the “bread bowls” onto a baking sheet. Spread the bottom of each with a good portion of the sauce. Then divide the ground beef mixture among the rolls (you don’t want these to over flow too much, so use less beef if necessary). Layer the mushrooms and the pepperoni on top of the beef. Now top the each bun with the mozzarella cheese. The mixture/cheese should come just barely above the top of the bun as it will sink a little as it cooks. Cook the deep dish pizzas for about 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbling, the bread is slightly toasted, and the ingredients are warmed through.

Cover with a microwaveable, round heavy plastic cover. Microwave on HIGH (full power) for 7 to 8 minutes. Cooking time could vary slightly, depending on the wattage of your microwave. You do not have to turn the sliced potatoes over. If you do not have a bacon tray, use a microwave safe casserole dish. Rub the inside of the dish with some olive oil for the first batch of potato chips. I do not know why, but I find that if you do not rub oil the first time, some chips will tend to stick to the dish. After the first batch is done, you do not have to rub the dish again. Continue to microwave the remainder of sliced potatoes as noted above. NOTE: You can also use PARCHMENT PAPER to place your potato slices. Place your potato slices, then sprinkle them with whatever you like and then place another piece of parchment paper on top.

Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a saute pan, add 2 t garlic, and cook for 30 seconds (without browning.) Stir in the tomato sauce and paste, simmer until thickened. Stir in basil and oregano, set aside to cool. Head 2 T of the oil and saute the mushrooms until lightly browned and the liquid is evaporated. Season to taste, and set aside to cool.

Sprinkle 1 c of the mozzarella over the dough. Spread the tomato sauce across the cheese, spread the mushrooms over the tomatoes, and cover with 1 c of mozzarella.   Roll out the remaining dough to approximately a 14" circle. Brush the sides of the dough inside the pan with water. Fit the 14" round into the pan. Press edges (pull if necessary) against the moistened dough to seal it. Trim the overhanging dough to 1/2" and wet it again. Fold inward and crimp to form a raised rim around the pan edge. Cut a steam vent in the top layer of the dough, and brush with 1 T of the oil.   Spread the sausage across the dough and cover with the broccoli. Combine the remaining cheeses and sprinkle across the broccoli; drizzle with 1/4 c of oil.   Bake in a preheated 425 degree oven for 30-40 minutes. Freezes well. Ideas: put the broccoli and sausage on the lower layer, and the tomatoes and mushrooms on the top layer. This way the broccoli stays moist.

Cut with biscuit cutters and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake for approximately 12 to 15 minutes at 450°F. If making cheese biscuits, add the cheese after the shortening has been cut into the flour. Tip: An easy way to cut the butter into the flour is to use a box grater. The large side of the grater makes the perfect size pieces of butter. Options: You can use any favourite cheese. Gorgonzola and other blue cheeses are wonderful with the addition of black pepper. Cheddar cheese is good with chives or green onions. Sometimes I add dry mustard and cayenne pepper.

NOTE: This flour and spice dredge mix is sufficient for two batches of this pork chop recipe. You can store the leftover mix in a Ziploc bag in the freezer for the next time you make this recipe (or the chicken version)...and there will be a next time.

Dip the chop into the eggwash and then a final time into the flour and spice mix, pressing the mix into the meat to get good contact.

Once they were done I drained out the remaining water, let them cool and then mixed an egg in with them. I then dumped the noodles onto a cutting board and spread them out until the pile was about a half of an inch thick all the way around. After that I cut two bread-sized square pieces of ramen out of the pile using a knife and placed each one between two pieces of wax paper and put them in my refrigerator. About 20 minutes later my newly created ramen noodle “bread slices” were holding together quite nicely so I took them out of the refrigerator and threw them into a pan on my stove where I heated them both up for a few minutes each on one side. Then, I flipped one of them over, added a couple slices of cheese, added the second one on top of it and just finished frying them like you would with a regular grilled cheese sandwich. When my Ramen Grilled Cheese was finished the noodles ended up nice and crispy on the outside, yet still soft and noodle-like on the inside. In a way ramen works almost better than bread in a grilled cheese because when the cheese melts it sort of fills in all the little nooks and crannies between the noodles. much more at http://dudefoods.com/the-ramen-noodle-grilled-cheese-sandwich/",2024-08-22,http://myfridgefood.com/Media/Recipe/food133-001.jpg
